Projects for the Image and Video Analysis and Technology class 2019-202o in NTUA ECE


This is the code for the two projects of my NTUA ECE Image and Video Analysis and Technology class 2019 course.

In the 1st Assignement we used edge detection algorithms to produce cartoonified images as well as locate moving elements in surveillance videos by using feature extraction algorithms movement estimaiton techniques.

In the 2nd Assignement we developed neural networks (MLP, CNNs, transfer learning) and tried different optimizations.

The Specific Questions can be seen in the notebooks. In the 1st Assignment, the image analysis is done in a notebook where as the video analysis in the python file (but the questions can still be found in the "Questions" notebook.
